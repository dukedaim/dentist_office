### Java Web App
Hi this is a simple Java Web App developed using NetBeans IDE. This application serves as a dynamic platform for managing appointments and user credentials within a dental practice enviornment.

### Technologies Used
The main programming language used was Java. The structure and styling were done with HTML and CSS. There was very little front-end style done with JavaScript.

### Features
- **User Authentication**: Patients and dentists have personalized accounts with the ability to change their credentials.
- **Appointment Management**:
  - **Patients**: Can create, modify, or cancel appointments.
  - **Dentists**: Have streamlined view of current appointments.
- **Database Integration**: Utilizes Microsoft Access as the backend database for data management.
